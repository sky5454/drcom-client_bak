These English instructions were written by Sridhar Ramasami a foreign
teacher at Lanzhou Jiaotong University
on Mar 18 2009 for drcom version 1.4.8.1.

DrCom is a client authentication system used by several universities and
companies for client login, billing etc.  A windows version is available 
from the drcom company itself, but no versions for linux is available 
from them. This is a linux version developed under the GNU license.

The following steps are involved in installing and configuring the
software to work correctly:

1) Download the latest version of drcom

2) Extract and compile drcom on your machine.  This requires a library
   called 'build-essential' on your system.  First install this and then
   proceed with the compilation.

   Below are the required commands:

      $ tar xzvf drcom-x.x.x.tar.gz
      $ cd drcom-x.x.x
      $ make
      $ sudo make install

   In the above replace x.x.x with your version number

3) Change the configuration file /etc/drcom.conf.  This can be done with
   the command:
      $ gedit /etc/drcom.conf
   You will require root or super user status to make changes.  For Ubuntu or
   similar systems your command instead of the above would then be:
      $ sudo gedit /etc/drcom.conf

   Following changes are require in the drcom.conf file
     a) enter the appropriate username and password as supplied by the service
        provider. for example

        username=sridhar
        password=ubuntu

     b) enter the appropriat device that will be connecting to the network: for
        example:

        device=eth0

     c) enter the appropriate except, dnsp and dnss ip addresses: eg:

        except=192.168.22.126/255.255.255.128
        dnsp=221.7.40.200
        dnss=202.201.18.68
        dhcp=

        The 'except' statement is important, it is composed of one or more 
        following entry, separated by ',': 

		subnet-address/netmask-of-subnet

	It should contain the network address of those subnets which you can 
        access directly(i.e., no authentication is needed). In most cases, it is 
        the internal network of your ISP.

        The 'dhcp' statement is currently not processed. 

     d) enter the server ip: eg:

        hostip=
        servip=196.168.22.126

     e) save the file

4) Log in using the following commands:

        $ sudo drcomd
        $ drcomc login

   Note: Due to different versions of drcom server, you may not be able to
   login at the first attempt.  In such cases just repeat the command:

        $ drcomc login

   Also the network wire (if connected physically) should be connected when
   testing or you will get an error that says there was an error at line 3 
   of drcom.conf file.


5) Logout with
        $ drcomc logout
